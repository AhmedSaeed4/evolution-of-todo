# Feature Specification: ChatKit Integration

**Feature Branch**: `010-chatkit-integration`
**Created**: 2026-01-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "name the new branch "010-chatkit-integration" and here are the specs: [user provided specs]"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Seamless Chat Experience with Modern UI (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to interact with the AI agent through a polished, professional chat interface that provides real-time messaging, loading states, and rich responses, so I can manage my tasks naturally without technical friction.

**Why this priority**: The current chat interface is basic and lacks modern UX patterns. OpenAI Chat Kit provides battle-tested components that will significantly improve user experience and reduce development time while maintaining professional quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending a message to the agent and verifying the chat interface renders correctly with proper message bubbles, loading states, and response display.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on the chat page, **When** they type a message and hit send, **Then** the message appears in the chat with proper user styling and the agent responds with appropriate assistant styling
2. **Given** agent is processing a request, **When** there's a delay, **Then** user sees a loading indicator and cannot send duplicate messages
3. **Given** agent returns a response, **When** the response contains markdown or structured data, **Then** it renders properly in the chat interface

### User Story 2 - Task Management via Natural Conversation (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to create, view, update, and delete tasks using natural Urdu/English conversation in the chat interface, so I can manage my tasks without leaving the chat context.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the application. The Chat Kit should enhance this experience with better message threading and tool call visibility.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending task-related commands and verifying they execute correctly with clear visual feedback in the chat.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user types "create task for tomorrow", **When** agent processes the request, **Then** chat shows the tool call and result with clear visual separation
2. **Given** user asks "show my tasks", **When** agent lists tasks, **Then** response is formatted clearly in the chat with task details
3. **Given** user has ongoing conversation, **When** they reference previous messages, **Then** context is maintained throughout the chat session

---

### User Story 3 - Multi-language Support with Cultural Context (Priority: P3)

As a Urdu-speaking user, I want the chat interface to seamlessly handle Urdu text input/output and maintain cultural appropriateness, so I can interact comfortably in my preferred language.

**Why this priority**: While functional, this enhances accessibility and user satisfaction for the target audience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by sending Urdu messages and verifying proper rendering and response in Urdu.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user types in Urdu script, **When** message is sent, **Then** it displays correctly with proper text direction and font support
2. **Given** agent responds in Urdu, **When** response is received, **Then** it renders with proper Urdu typography and layout

---

### User Story 4 - Persistent Chat History (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want all my chat conversations to be automatically saved to the database and accessible across sessions, so I can review previous discussions and maintain continuity across devices.

**Why this priority**: Chat history is essential for user experience and data persistence. Users need to reference past conversations and task discussions. This leverages our existing Neon database infrastructure.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having a conversation, refreshing the page, and verifying previous messages are loaded.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user completes a chat session, **When** they navigate away and return, **Then** previous conversation is automatically loaded from Neon database
2. **Given** user has multiple chat sessions, **When** they view chat history, **Then** they can see and access all previous conversations
3. **Given** user creates tasks via chat, **When** they review chat history, **Then** task-related discussions are preserved with context
4. **Given** user switches between devices, **When** they log in, **Then** their chat history is available across all devices

### Edge Cases

- What happens when OpenAI Chat Kit fails to load or has network issues?
- How does the system handle very long messages that exceed display limits?
- What happens when agent responses contain errors or tool calls fail?
- How does the interface handle concurrent user messages during processing?
- What happens with special characters, emojis, or very wide content in messages?
